If you can only attend a portion of the conference in person, you can still participate in the rest of the conference virtually. Follow the instructions on the virtual attendance for instructions to do this.   </p> Can I get a discount for volunteering or speaking? <p>Accepted speakers will get a free ticket to the event. </p> What is your refund policy? <p>In the event of cancellation prior to 7 days before the conference, registration  fees will be fully refunded. After this time period, we will refund 50% of the registration price. For any pre-order items (e.g. t-shirts), orders  will be refunded if cancellation happens before the production order is made.</p> How much of my sponsorship or ticket price goes to the conference? <p>The short answer is: as much as is needed. Our goal each year is to put on the best conference we can muster. In the event that we gather more funds from sponsorship or ticket sales than we need for the conference, we simply roll the remainder over to the next year. This helps us build a sustainable offering that Texas Python developers can rely on year after year.</p> <p>We aspire eventually to use excess funds to support outreach programs, day care for conference attendees who are parents, scholarships for underprivileged attendees, and other worthy expenses that further the goals of the PyTexas Foundation. We welcome your input on how we can best assist the Texas Python community!</p> My organization doesn't use Python. Why should I sponsor PyTexas? <p>There are several reasons to consider sponsoring the PyTexas conference even if your organization doesn't currently use Python. First, you should consider using Python! It's a remarkably flexible language that has established libraries for and applications in web development, data science, science at large, and more.</p> <p>Second, the trend in modern software development is toward polyglot programming. That is, the best developers are competent in multiple languages and prefer to \"pick the right tool for the job.\" Polyglot programmers can bring to the table idioms and architectures that aren't apparent to developers steeped in only one technology. Even if your organization primarily uses Go or Ruby, you can increase your recruiting reach and encourage internal innovation by hiring smart developers -- regardless of what language they work in today. You can even make this part of your presence at the conference! Feel free to submit a \"X for Pythonistas\" talk; we promise it will get due consideration.</p> Is my contribution to PyTexas tax-deductible? <p>The PyTexas Foundation was organized as a Texas non-profit corporation in 2014 and received its 501(c)(3) recognition in early 2015. Although we cannot guarantee that your contribution to PyTexas will be tax-deductible (we aren\u2019t tax attorneys and just don\u2019t know), you can rest assured that any contributions to the organization will always be used to further the common goals of the Texas Python community, and never for personal benefit.</p>"},{"location":"slido/","title":"Slido","text":"<p>Redirect file.
